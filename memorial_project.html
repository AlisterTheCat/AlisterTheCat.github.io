      <h2 id="Dsoup"> Children of Deceased Warriors</h2>

        <p><strong>Children have lost parents in wars due to acts of violence and cruelty. It is our responsiblity to look after these children. We can do this by giving to the Food Banks of America and all around the world, and also letting them into our homes and hearts.  I would like to thank the people who have already done this.<stroung></p>
